# Gothic
Git repository demonstrating 12 different scenarios on how MetaEdit+ supports co-evolution of domain-specific modeling languages, tools and models. Each scenario is its own version in Git, following on from the changes in the previous scenarios.

## Quick Start

**To see the automatic model and tool co-evolution as you change the modeling language in MetaEdit+:**

1. Install MetaEdit+ from https://metacase.com/download/

2. Download the intial MetaEdit+ repository version, the binary file asset [GothicAfter0.zip](https://github.com/mccjpt/Gothic/releases/download/0/GothicAfter0.zip) from Release 0 here.

3. Expand GothicAfter0.zip to form a new GothicAfter0 folder in your MetaEdit+ working directory (e.g. Documents\MetaEdit+ 5.5)

4. Start MetaEdit+, select the new 'GothicAfter0' repository and 'Gothic Security' project, and Login. 

5. Follow the instructions in the [Co-evolution Example](https://www.metacase.com/support/55/manuals/Co-evolution%20Example.pdf) PDF to carry out the 12 co-evolution scenarios.

_For more details about co-evolution, see the published [article](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10270-024-01218-5) in the Software and Systems Modeling journal._
